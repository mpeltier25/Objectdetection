# Objectdetection
Object detection using C++ and opencv: https://opencv.org/

This is rudimentary Object Detection using C++ and Opencv, it allows you to adjust the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) until you get the desired object to be detected. You could use this program in conjunction on Hue Saturation and Value for your Visual Object datasets if you feel inclined to do so, it may be easier to use this program and your web camera to see what the Object looks like.
